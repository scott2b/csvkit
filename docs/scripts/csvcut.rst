    Filter and truncate CSV files. Like unix "cut" command, but for tabular data.

    positional arguments:
      FILE                  The CSV file to operate on. If omitted, will accept
                            input on STDIN.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -n, --names           Display column names and indices from the input CSV
                            and exit.
      -c COLUMNS, --columns COLUMNS
                            A comma separated list of column indices or names to
                            be extracted. Defaults to all columns.
      -l, --linenumbers     Insert a column of line numbers at the front of the
                            output. Useful when piping to grep or as a simple
                            primary key.

Note that csvcut does not include row filtering, for this you should pipe data to :doc:`csvgrep`.

Also see: :doc:`common_arguments`.
