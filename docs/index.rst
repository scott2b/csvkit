About

.. include:: ../README

Principles
==========

csvkit is to tabular data what the standard Unix text processing suite (grep, sed, cut, sort) is to text. As such, csvkit adheres to `the Unix philosophy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy>`_.

#. Small is beautiful.
#. Make each program do one thing well.
#. Build a prototype as soon as possible.
#. Choose portability over efficiency.
#. Store data in flat text files.
#. Use software leverage to your advantage.
#. Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.
#. Avoid captive user interfaces.
#. Make every program a filter.

As there is no formally defined CSV format, csvkit encourages well-known formatting standards:

* Output favors compatability with the widest range of applications. This means that quoting is done with double-quotes and only when necessary, columns are separated with commas, and lines are terminated with unix style line endings ("\\n").

* Data that is modified or generated will prefer consistency over brevity. Floats always include at least one decimal place, even if they are round. Dates and times are written in ISO8601 format.

Installation
============

Users
-----

If you only want to use csvkit, install it this way::

    pip install csvkit

If you are installing on Ubuntu you may need to install the Python development headers prior to install csvkit::

    sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-setuptools build-essential

If the installation appears to be successful but running the tools fails, try updating your version of Python setuptools:

    pip install setuptools --upgrade
    pip install csvkit --upgrade

.. note::

    csvkit is routinely tested on OSX, somewhat less frequently on Linux and once in a while on Windows. All platforms are supported. It is tested against Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and PyPy. Neither Python < 2.6 nor Python < 3.3 are supported at this time.

Developers
----------

If you are a developer that also wants to hack on csvkit, install it this way::

    git clone git://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit.git
    cd csvkit
    mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages csvkit

    # If running Python 2
    pip install -r requirements-py2.txt

    # If running Python 3
    pip install -r requirements-py3.txt

    python setup.py develop
    tox

.. note::

    If you are using Python2 and have a recent version of pip, you may need to run pip with the additional arguments :code:`--allow-external argparse`.
    
Tutorial
